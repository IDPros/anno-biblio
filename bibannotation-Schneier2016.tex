I was fortunate enough to be colleagues with and meet Bruce Schneier for a short stint when his company was acquired by my then employer, BT. His insights into IT security are always spot on, acute, and entertaining. One of his latest books focuses on the data we generate as consumers, employees, citizens, and how that data can be spied on, pried, collected, and turned against us. It's a stark reminder that, even though we 'have nothing to hide', we should care about privacy more than ever.
