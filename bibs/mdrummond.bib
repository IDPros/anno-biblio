  annotation={This series of videos, hosted by Auth0, are an excellent introduction to some of the details of the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols, and how they are implemented. The target audience is an experienced developer or identity professional who is relatively new to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

A note about vendor independence: For the most part, these videos do not mention Auth0, with the exception of the first video, “Introduction to Identity”, where Auth0’s offering is given a bit of a general overview. The first video can likely be skipped without loss.
