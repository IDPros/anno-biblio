    annotation={It is interesting how much the world has changed since this book came out.
    And it is also interesting how much is still relevant.
    Sure you can smirk at some of the examples, such as a line speed of 600 characters per minute!  However, it does a good job of the basics on Authentication and Authorization - many of the considerations are the same - although this predates public key technology and packet switched networks were not yet widely adopted.
    Chapter 5 is an excellent introduction to ciphers leading up to the P-boxes and S-boxes used Data Encryption Standard.  Good background for more modern crypto!
    There is also a long bibliography of historical interest.}

  For example distinguishing between claims an assertions based on the connotation or not of doubt.
  How sad that 2005 era vision of user control and consent has not yet been universally accepted in 2018.
  In 2018 this document still provides a powerful framework for thought about identities.}
