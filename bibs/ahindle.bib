  annotation={If you work in a startup, this book is pretty much required reading.  It's tremendously helpful to understand how and why to make the product and business decisions needed to have a decent chance at longer term success.
  And if you are not the one making the decisions, it's useful to understand the wider context when those decisions get made and impact you.  Moore published an updated versino in 2014; and it's also worth looking at the follow-up book 'Into the Tornado'}
