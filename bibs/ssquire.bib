	abstract = {Digital infrastructure is increasingly the backbone of prosperous economies, vigorous research communities, strong militaries, transparent governments, and free societies. As never before, information technology is fostering transnational dialogue and facilitating the global flow of goods and services. These social and trade links have become indispensable to our daily lives. Critical life-sustaining infrastructures that deliver electricity and water, control air traffic, and support our financial system all depend on networked information systems. Governments are now able to streamline the provision of essential services through eGovernment initiatives. Social and political movements rely on the Internet to enable new and more expansive forms of organization and action. The reach of networked technol- ogy is pervasive and global. For all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.},

  annotation={This paper was produced by the US Government during the Obama administration and outlines in basic English why the United States does not want to have a central government directory or a central government identity provider. It speculates as to how government could enable the private sector to fill that gap in very smart and innovative ways that protect citizen privacy and prevent government overreach. }
