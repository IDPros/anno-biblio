  annotation={OAuth is a very powerful tool. Its power comes from its flexibility. Flexibility often means the ability to not only do what you want to do, but also the ability to do things in an unsafe way. Because OAuth governs access to APIs, which in turn gates access to your important data, it’s crucial that you do use it in a safe way by avoiding antipatterns and using best practices. Stated differently, just because you have the flexibility to do anything and deploy in any way, doesn’t mean that you should.

Thankfully, Justin and Antonio provide pragmatic guidance on what to do and what not to do. They acknowledge both the “I just want to get this done” and the “I want to make sure this is secure” mindsets you have.

(Full disclosure… I wrote the Foreword for the book) }

  annotation={Less on the pragmatic and more on the philosophical end of the spectrum, Clippinger’s work lays highlights some of a questions our industry must face. Although a bit dated, A Crowd of One is still worth a read, if only to help trigger “big thoughts” on identity. }
