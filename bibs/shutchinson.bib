  annotation={I purchased this book shortly after its release after reading one of David Birch’s online posts about the rise of social identity in parallel to the decline of cash in our modern world. He begins with a synopsis of how broken our definitions of ‘identity’ are and focuses on three primary types: personal individual identity, social identity, and legal identity. Of these, he singles out social identity (which he differentiates from social media) with the observation that “identity is returning to a concept built on networks, rather than index cards in a filing cabinet.” The book is also loaded with real-world case studies to highlight and support David’s conclusions. Even those seasoned professionals who feel that there’s little more to learn from a book will find important insights here that have certainly shaped my own view on the future of identity, identity systems, and the frameworks that support them. }

@book{Hardjono2016,
  author={Hardjono, Thomas, et al., editors.},
  title={Trust::Data: A New Framework for Identity and Data Sharing},
  shorttitle={Trust::Data},
  publisher={VisionaryFuture},
  date={2016},
  ibsn={9781539114215},
  pages = {312 pages},
  annotation={A wonderful academic discussion on the need for our identity and data security systems to adapt to a world that has moved from a physical document-based culture to one built on digital transactions. The book includes in-depth examinations of user centricity, data privacy, distributed trust authorities, universal access, and many other topics. It also includes some possible solutions (such as MIT’s OPAL/ENIGMA systems). The solutions presented are more reliant on blockchain than I care for but followers of UMA will see much in here familiar and well presented. You may not agree with everything in the book but it superbly researched and documented. The 20-page bibliography alone is worth the price of admission as it allows you to delve deeper into specific topics with the source material. }

@book{Richer2017,
  author={Richer, Justin and Sanso, Antonio},
  title={OAuth 2 in Action},
  shorttitle={OAuth 2 in Action},
  publisher={Manning Publications},
  date={2017},
  ibsn={9781617293276},
  pages = {360 pages},
  annotation={This is not only the most comprehensive book available about OAuth but it is also the most accessible, which is a neat trick to pull off. Justin and Antonio expertly guide the reader by providing an overview of what OAuth is by talking about why it came to be and what it was meant to solve. They describe the flow between all of the different players in the framework followed by dedicated chapters for each one of those participants before presenting the reader with more advanced topics. One of those is easily the best description ever written about dynamic client registration, which I have referred to many times in our own implementation. As a cybersecurity architect, I particularly appreciate the 50 pages of detailed discussion about common vulnerabilities of different parts of the system. It’s a fantastic resource that you’ll not only refer to again and again, but also a resource to lend to those new identity professionals that you’re trying to grow. }
