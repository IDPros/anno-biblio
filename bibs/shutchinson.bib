  annotation={I purchased this book shortly after its release after reading one of David Birch’s online posts about the rise of social identity in parallel to the decline of cash in our modern world. He begins with a synopsis of how broken our definitions of ‘identity’ are and focuses on three primary types: personal individual identity, social identity, and legal identity. Of these, he singles out social identity (which he differentiates from social media) with the observation that “identity is returning to a concept built on networks, rather than index cards in a filing cabinet.” The book is also loaded with real-world case studies to highlight and support David’s conclusions. Even those seasoned professionals who feel that there’s little more to learn from a book will find important insights here that have certainly shaped my own view on the future of identity, identity systems, and the frameworks that support them. }

@book{Hardjono2016,
	abstract = {As the economy and society move from a world where interactions were physical and based on paper documents, toward a world that is primarily governed by digital data and digital transactions, our existing methods of managing identity and data security are proving inadequate. Large-scale fraud, identity theft and data breaches are becoming common, and a large fraction of the population have only the most limited digital credentials. Even so, our digital infrastructure is recognized as a strategic asset which must be resilient to threat. If we can create an Internet of Trusted Data that provides safe, secure access for everyone, then huge societal benefits can be unlocked, including better health, greater financial inclusion, and a population that is more engaged with and better supported by its government. Some of the world's leading data scientists, led by MIT Professor Alex Pentland, describe a roadmap and platforms to implement this new paradigm.},

	publisher = {VisionaryFuture},
	shorttitle = {Trust::Data},
	title = {{Trust::Data: A New Framework for Identity and Data Sharing}},
	year = {2016},
  annotation={A wonderful academic discussion on the need for our identity and data security systems to adapt to a world that has moved from a physical document-based culture to one built on digital transactions. The book includes in-depth examinations of user centricity, data privacy, distributed trust authorities, universal access, and many other topics. It also includes some possible solutions (such as MIT’s OPAL/ENIGMA systems). The solutions presented are more reliant on blockchain than I care for but followers of UMA will see much in here familiar and well presented. You may not agree with everything in the book but it superbly researched and documented. The 20-page bibliography alone is worth the price of admission as it allows you to delve deeper into specific topics with the source material. }

	title = {{OAuth 2 in Action}},
	year = {2017},
  annotation={This is not only the most comprehensive book available about OAuth but it is also the most accessible, which is a neat trick to pull off. Justin and Antonio expertly guide the reader by providing an overview of what OAuth is by talking about why it came to be and what it was meant to solve. They describe the flow between all of the different players in the framework followed by dedicated chapters for each one of those participants before presenting the reader with more advanced topics. One of those is easily the best description ever written about dynamic client registration, which I have referred to many times in our own implementation. As a cybersecurity architect, I particularly appreciate the 50 pages of detailed discussion about common vulnerabilities of different parts of the system. It’s a fantastic resource that you’ll not only refer to again and again, but also a resource to lend to those new identity professionals that you’re trying to grow. }

	year = {2017},
  annotation={This is one of my new favorite books in the identity and cybersecurity space. Saryu has brought together insights from over a dozen CISOs and CIOs give their views on the state of cybersecurity in the age of zero trust. The common thread in all of their perspectives is "the amplified view of the value of identity and access." I love the book not only because it covers a wide array of identity topics but because it is visionary in its view of what's important now and in the immediate future. I particularly appreciate that, in the end, Saryu takes the input of those contributing security professionals and uses them to provide clear requirements and use cases for what's next: such things as Predictive Security Analysis, Identity Analytics, and User and Entity Behavior Analytics. A fantastic read for any security and/or identity professional. }

	year = {2018},
  annotation={Mike Schwartz and Maciej Machulak have done an admirable job in creating a primer on identity management that can be used by both professionals who are new to the IAM field as well as those in other fields who just want to understand the IAM space better and/or to discern how IAM services interact with their own. The authors start with the most basic concepts of IAM and step the reader through to more complex subjects: LDAP to SAML to OAuth to OpenID Connect, etc.. Where this book differentiates itself from other works is its inclusion of Free Open Source Software (FOSS) that is available for each use case to allow the reader to build their own IAM systems to put the principles into practice. I also appreciate that the authors reached out to industry experts to review the more recent advances like FIDO, WebAuthN, and UMA. A great addition to any company’s library of material for new identity professionals. }
