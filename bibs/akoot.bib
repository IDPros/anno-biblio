@book{Harper2006,
	abstract = {The advance of identification technology biometrics, identity cards, surveillance, databases, dossiers threatens privacy, civil liberties, and related human interests. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, demands for identification in the name of security have increased. In this insightful book, Jim Harper takes readers inside identification a process everyone uses every day but few people have ever thought about. Using stories and examples from movies, television, and classic literature, Harper dissects identification processes and technologies, showing how identification works when it works and how it fails when it fails. Harper exposes the myth that identification can protect against future terrorist attacks. He shows that a U.S. national identification card, created by Congress in the REAL ID Act, is a poor way to secure the country or its citizens. A national ID represents a transfer of power from individuals to institutions, and that transfer threatens liberty, enables identity fraud, and subjects people to unwanted surveillance. Instead of a uniform, government-controlled identification system, Harper calls for a competitive, responsive identification and credentialing industry that meets the mix of consumer demands for privacy, security, anonymity, and accountability. Identification should be a risk-reducing strategy in a social system, Harper concludes, not a rivet to pin humans to governmental or economic machinery.},

  annotation={I really love the subtitle. We should care more about Access, than about Identity. Especially in federated contexts, identity is no longer the bearer of authorizations. Jim explains the concept of identity and the context identities can be used in. And why you don't always need to be identified to be able to use a resource. Required reading for all Identity Professionals! }

This practical guide discusses the impacts of identity management on organizations from a businessperson’s perspective. This book will help managers and CIOs understand: • Automating identity provisioning into your access control systems • How to evaluate the maturity of your identity management environment • The difference between authentication and authorization • Why federated authentication is so important and how to get it right • How roles and attributes are used to determine access control • The level of digital transformation that’s coming in the management of consumer identities. • What we need to plan for in operational technology and the Internet of Things.},

  annotation={Graham's book can be seen as a complete overview of the Identity and Access Management playing field. It shows not only the broad field of IAM, from internal B2E and B2B to B2C, but it also covers modern not directly identity management oriented topics like Industrial Control Systems. It's a well written book, covering more than Identity and Access alone, containing lots of examples and use cases, but I feel that a glossary explaining terms and abbreviations could help the target group of business managers and CIO's.}

@online{NIST800207-2020,
	abstract = {Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise’s overall information technology security posture.},

It is the first source explicitly adding the concept of policy based access control (known from XACML and ABAC) to the common network oriented zero trust infrastructure. The document shows multiple reference implementations of the zero trust models.
	It's not only a very good explanation of the concept, but it's also an easy read. An essential standard work for future access control developments.}
