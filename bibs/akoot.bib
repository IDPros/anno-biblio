@book{Harper2006,
	abstract = {The advance of identification technology biometrics, identity cards, surveillance, databases, dossiers threatens privacy, civil liberties, and related human interests. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, demands for identification in the name of security have increased. In this insightful book, Jim Harper takes readers inside identification a process everyone uses every day but few people have ever thought about. Using stories and examples from movies, television, and classic literature, Harper dissects identification processes and technologies, showing how identification works when it works and how it fails when it fails. Harper exposes the myth that identification can protect against future terrorist attacks. He shows that a U.S. national identification card, created by Congress in the REAL ID Act, is a poor way to secure the country or its citizens. A national ID represents a transfer of power from individuals to institutions, and that transfer threatens liberty, enables identity fraud, and subjects people to unwanted surveillance. Instead of a uniform, government-controlled identification system, Harper calls for a competitive, responsive identification and credentialing industry that meets the mix of consumer demands for privacy, security, anonymity, and accountability. Identification should be a risk-reducing strategy in a social system, Harper concludes, not a rivet to pin humans to governmental or economic machinery.},

  annotation={I really love the subtitle. We should care more about Access, than about Identity. Especially in federated contexts, identity is no longer the bearer of authorizations. Jim explains the concept of identity and the context identities can be used in. And why you don't always need to be identified to be able to use a resource. Required reading for all Identity Professionals! }

  annotation={Graham's book can be seen as a complete overview of the Identity and Access Management playing field. It shows not only the broad field of IAM, from internal B2E and B2B to B2C, but it also covers modern not directly identity management oriented topics like Industrial Control Systems. It's a well written book, covering more than Identity and Access alone, containing lots of examples and use cases, but I feel that a glossary explaining terms and abbreviations could help the target group of business managers and CIO's.}
