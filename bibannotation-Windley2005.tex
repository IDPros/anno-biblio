I've used Phil's resource before in several contexts, including:

a) Course textbook for an online course in enterprise identity management

b) Selecting some chapters as "homework assignments" for newcomers to our IDAM Team

c) Educating decision-makers on the governance aspects of identity management in enterprise.

His chapter 15 example of an Identity Management Maturity (IMM) model is outstanding.

This book starts with the basics of digital identity - what you know,
what you have, what you are. From there it provides a broad overview of many important
concepts. It is an accessible book and caters to beginner and expert readers alike and
best of all, it can be read cover to cover in one sitting.
