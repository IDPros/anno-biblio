This paper is a great introduction to the world of Zero Trust computing. It is the first source explicitly adding the concept of policy based access control (known from XACML and ABAC) to the common network oriented zero trust infrastructure. The document shows multiple reference implementations of the zero trust models.
	It's not only a very good explanation of the concept, but it's also an easy read. An essential standard work for future access control developments.
