Graham's book can be seen as a complete overview of the Identity and Access Management playing field. It shows not only the broad field of IAM, from internal B2E and B2B to B2C, but it also covers modern not directly identity management oriented topics like Industrial Control Systems. It's a well written book, covering more than Identity and Access alone, containing lots of examples and use cases, but I feel that a glossary explaining terms and abbreviations could help the target group of business managers and CIO's.

It was written to help business people understand IAM, the trends and the responsibilities of those collecting, using and storing identity data.
