It is interesting how much the world has changed since this book came out.
    And it is also interesting how much is still relevant.
    Sure, you can smirk at some of the examples, such as a line speed of 600 characters per minute!  However, the text does a good job of the basics on Authentication and Authorization - many of the considerations have remained the same. Although, to be fair, this book predates public key technology and packet switched networks were not yet widely adopted.
    Chapter 5 is an excellent introduction to ciphers leading up to the P-boxes and S-boxes used Data Encryption Standard.  Good background for more modern crypto!
    There is also a long bibliography of historical interest.
