A wonderful academic discussion on the need for our identity and data security systems to adapt to a world that has moved from a physical document-based culture to one built on digital transactions. The book includes in-depth examinations of user centricity, data privacy, distributed trust authorities, universal access, and many other topics. It also includes some possible solutions (such as MIT’s OPAL/ENIGMA systems). The solutions presented are more reliant on blockchain than I care for but followers of UMA will see much in here familiar and well presented. You may not agree with everything in the book but it superbly researched and documented. The 20-page bibliography alone is worth the price of admission as it allows you to delve deeper into specific topics with the source material.
