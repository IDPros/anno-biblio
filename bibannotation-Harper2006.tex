I really love the subtitle. We should care more about Access, than about Identity. Especially in federated contexts, identity is no longer the bearer of authorizations. Jim explains the concept of identity and the context identities can be used in. And why you don't always need to be identified to be able to use a resource. Required reading for all Identity Professionals!
