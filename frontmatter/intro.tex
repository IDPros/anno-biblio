\section{Introduction}
This document is intended as an a way to convey some of the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of the members of IDPro.
It is in the form of an annotated bibliography, where the references may be books, articles, or any other form of knowledge transfer.  At the same time, this document is a way for individual members of IDPro to highlight their experience and expertise.  It is not intended to be a marketplace.  Rather it is a way to extend the benefits of community to the members of IDPro.

All members of IDPro are encouraged to make contributions, either of material they have found useful in their career, or of content they have personally developed that others may find useful.  All contributions of content are appreciated. The contributors' biographic details, likenesses, and annotations are subject to only to light editing by the Body of Knowledge Committee.  The contributors are encouraged to submit annotations that are fresh, friendly, and fun. You may find some of them contain a degree of humor not normally associated with something as dry as knowledge transfer.

Please contact info@idpro.org for the best method to contribute.
