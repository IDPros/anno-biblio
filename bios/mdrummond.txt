Mark is the Director of Identity and Access Management for the Empire Life Insurance Company in Kingston, Ontario, and a part-time undergraduate student at Queen's University, pursuing a B.A. in Economics. "Pursuing" in the sense of a sloth pursuing another branch in a tree, the Guinness World Records is monitoring his progress closely.

After 15-odd years working with LDAP directory-based identity systems, Mark realized there was more to the Identity game than LDIF change files. He is super excited to be catching up with the rest of the pack and very keen on everything happening in the decentralized and self-sovereign identity space.

Mark spends his in between hours riding his motorcycle, reading, and playing video games.
