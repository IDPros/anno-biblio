Mark is the Director of Identity & Access Management for the Empire Life
Insurance Company in Kingston, Ontario, and a part-time undergraduate student
at Queen's University, pursuing a B.A. in Economics. "Pursuing" in the sense of
a sloth pursuing another branch in a tree, the Guinness World Records is
monitoring his progress closely.

After some 15-odd years working with LDAP directory-based identity solutions,
Mark realized there was more to the Identity game than LDIF change files. He is
super excited to be catching up to the rest of the pack, and very keen on
everything happening in the decentralized and self-sovereign identity space.

Mark spends his in between hours riding his motorcycle, reading, and playing
video games.
