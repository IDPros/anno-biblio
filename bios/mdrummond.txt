Mark is the Director of Identity and Access Management for the Empire Life Insurance Company in Kingston, Ontario, and a part-time undergraduate student at Queen's University, pursuing a B.A. in Economics. "Pursuing" in the sense of a sloth pursuing another branch in a tree, the Guiness Book of World Records is monitoring his progress closely.

After 15 odd years working with LDAP directory based identity systems, he found out there was more to the Identity game than he realized. He is super excited to be catching up to the rest of the pack, and very keen on everything happening in the decentralized and self-sovereign identity space.

He spends his in between hours riding his motorcycle, reading, and playing video games.
