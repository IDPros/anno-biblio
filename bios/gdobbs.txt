Although my day job is not currently involved directly with identity, I continue my long involvement with the subject in my role as chair of the IDPro Body of Knowledge Committee.  I also am a current board member IDPro.

In previous roles I have had extensive experience in the corporate world designing and implementing both worker and customer identity systems.  My most recent was in the area of so called "proofing" - how to recognize someone at a distance.  I am concerned with methods of sharing knowledge and know-how.
