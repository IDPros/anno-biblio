I am the Vice President for Identity, Privacy, and Data Governance Product Management, at Salesforce. I look after the product management team, product strategy and identity standards work. I am also involved with major customer initiatives, briefing C-level executives, and coordinating industry-wide identity efforts.

I used to be a research vice president and agenda manager on the Identity and Privacy Strategies team at Gartner, where I oversaw the entire team's research. I got to Gartner by way of Gartner's acquisition of the Burton Group. I led the team's coverage for authorization and privacy; topics within these two main areas included externalized authorization management, XACML, federated authorization, privacy by design, and privacy programs. Other topics I researched include user provisioning, identity and access governance, access certification, role management, identity data quality, and national identity programs.

My other work experience includes program management at a financial controls and governance, risk and compliance startup, director of identity strategy at a network-based admissions control company, and product management at IBM.

I am the founder and president of IDPro, the professional organization for digital identity management. I have previously served as the Editor for the Identity Relationship Management Working Group at the Kantara Initiative. I was a founding member of the Management Council and Board of Directors for the US Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG) - the private-sector lead body described in the US National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace.

During my decade-plus time in the identity industry I have co-authored a patent on federated user provisioning, co-authored the Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) Version 2 specification, contributed to the System for Cross Domain Identity Management (SCIM) Version 2 specification, and am a noted blogger, speaker, and photographer of my own socks.

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania cum laude with a Bachelors of Applied Science in Computer Science. I studied artificial intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. I currently reside in Washington DC.
