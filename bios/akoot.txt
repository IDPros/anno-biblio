Andr√© Koot is a principal consultant at SonicBee BV in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

My IAM experience comes from my financial accounting and auditing background. This background of anti-fraud detection and prevention business processes led to research in the area of authorization principles.

Currently I am working with different customers on federated identity and access architectures, both for internal and external identities (B2C, B2B, B2E and T2B - Things to Business).
My motivation to participate in the IDPro BoK project stems directly from my need to share knowledge as a lecturer, author, blogger, and social media activist. And from my mission to take infosec out of the realm of IT.
