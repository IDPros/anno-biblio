I am the Principal Cybersecurity Architect for GE Digital. After cutting my teeth in C/C++ software development and network engineering, I spent a decade as an enterprise architect in the healthcare sector focused on security and network technologies. In my current role at GE, I am responsible for strategy of one of the largest corporate identity infrastructures in the world and I oversee its evolution to provide the next generation of identity services required for GE’s “Industrial Internet.” I am a founding member of IDPro and honored to sit on the inaugural Board focused on community development, which has always been one of my passions. If you’re ever in Richmond, Virginia, on a Wednesday night, drop me a note for an invite to our biweekly backyard get-together.
