This is one of my new favorite books in the identity and cybersecurity space. Saryu has brought together insights from over a dozen CISOs and CIOs give their views on the state of cybersecurity in the age of zero trust. The common thread in all of their perspectives is "the amplified view of the value of identity and access." I love the book not only because it covers a wide array of identity topics but because it is visionary in its view of what's important now and in the immediate future. I particularly appreciate that, in the end, Saryu takes the input of those contributing security professionals and uses them to provide clear requirements and use cases for what's next: such things as Predictive Security Analysis, Identity Analytics, and User and Entity Behavior Analytics. A fantastic read for any security and/or identity professional.Â
