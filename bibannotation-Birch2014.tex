I purchased this book shortly after its release after reading one of David Birch’s online posts about the rise of social identity in parallel to the decline of cash in our modern world. He begins with a synopsis of how broken our definitions of ‘identity’ are and focuses on three primary types: personal individual identity, social identity, and legal identity. Of these, he singles out social identity (which he differentiates from social media) with the observation that “identity is returning to a concept built on networks, rather than index cards in a filing cabinet.” The book is also loaded with real-world case studies to highlight and support David’s conclusions. Even those seasoned professionals who feel that there’s little more to learn from a book will find important insights here that have certainly shaped my own view on the future of identity, identity systems, and the frameworks that support them.
