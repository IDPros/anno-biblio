Mike Schwartz and Maciej Machulak have done an admirable job in creating a primer on identity management that can be used by both professionals who are new to the IAM field as well as those in other fields who just want to understand the IAM space better and/or to discern how IAM services interact with their own. The authors start with the most basic concepts of IAM and step the reader through to more complex subjects: LDAP to SAML to OAuth to OpenID Connect, etc.. Where this book differentiates itself from other works is its inclusion of Free Open Source Software (FOSS) that is available for each use case to allow the reader to build their own IAM systems to put the principles into practice. I also appreciate that the authors reached out to industry experts to review the more recent advances like FIDO, WebAuthN, and UMA. A great addition to any company’s library of material for new identity professionals.
